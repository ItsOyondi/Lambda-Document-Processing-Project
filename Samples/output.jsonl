They need to\ntransport all these to various parts of\ntheir body. Further, animals need to\ntransport wastes to parts from where\nthey can be removed. Have you\nwondered how all this is achieved? Look\nat Fig. 7.1. Do you see the heart and\nthe blood vessels? They function to\ntransport substances and together form\nthe circulatory system. In this chapter,\nyou shall learn about transport of\nsubstances in animals and plants.\n7.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\nBlood\nWhat happens when you get a cut on\nyour body? Blood flows out. But what\nis blood? Blood is the fluid which\nflows in blood vessels. It transports\nsubstances like digested food from the\nsmall intestine to the other parts of the\nbody. It carries oxygen from the lungs\nto the cells of the body. It also transports\nwaste for removal from the body.\nHow does the blood carry various\nsubstances? Blood is composed of a\nfluid, called plasma in which different\ntypes of cells are suspended.\nHeart\nVein\nArtery\nWhy is the colour of\nblood red?\nFig. 7.1  Circulatory system\n(Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue)\nReprint 2024-25\n", "images": [{"path": "output_images/page_1_img_4.png", "metadata": {"width": 354, "height": 354, "ext": "png"}, "caption": "Transportation in"}, {"path": "output_images/page_1_img_5.png", "metadata": {"width": 2480, "height": 3508, "ext": "png"}, "caption": "Transportation in"}, {"path": "output_images/page_1_img_6.png", "metadata": {"width": 1894, "height": 1894, "ext": "png"}, "caption": "Transportation in"}]}

Haemoglobin\nbinds with oxygen and transports it to\nall the parts of the body and ultimately\nto all the cells. It will be difficult to\nprovide oxygen efficiently to all the cells\nof the body without haemoglobin. The\npresence of haemoglobin makes blood\nappear red.\nThe blood also has white blood cells\n(WBC) which fight against germs that\nmay enter our body.\nBoojho fell down while playing a\ngame and his knee got injured. Blood\nwas coming out from the cut. After some\ntime, he noticed that bleeding had\nstopped and a dark red clot had plugged\nthe cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.\nThe clot is formed because of the\npresence of another type of cells in the\nblood, called platelets.\nBlood vessels\nThere are different types of blood vessels\nin the body. You know that during\ninhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills\nthe lungs. Oxygen has to be transported\nto the rest of the body.\nAlso, the blood picks up the waste\nmaterials including carbon dioxide from\nthe cells. This blood has to go back to\nthe heart for transport to the lungs for\nremoval of carbon dioxide as you have\nlearnt in Chapter 6. So, two types of\nblood vessels,  arteries and veins are\npresent in the body. (Fig. 7.1)\nArteries carry oxygen-rich blood\nfrom the heart to all parts of the body.\nSince the blood flow is rapid and at a\nhigh pressure, the arteries have thick\nelastic walls.\nLet us perform an activity to study\nthe flow of blood through arteries.\nActivity 7.1\nPlace the middle and index finger of\nyour right hand on the inner side of your\nleft wrist (Fig. 7.2). Can you feel some\nthrobbing movements? Why do you\nthink there is throbbing? This\nthrobbing is called the pulse and it is\ndue to the blood flowing in the arteries.\nCount the number of pulse beats in one\nminute.\nHow many pulse beats could you\ncount? The number of beats per minute\nis called the pulse rate. A resting\nperson, usually has a pulse rate between\n72 and 80 beats per minute.
